Note: This guide is not including the numerous things you can do with your hardware, software and bios to optimise for a better experience, this is all strictly for Terraria.

Settings for Extreme LOW END PC:
Resolution - Highest and reduce if needed, fullscreen on.
Parallax - 0
Frame Skip - On or Subtle
Lighting - Retro
Quality - Low
Background - Off
Blood and Gore - Off
Miner's Wobble - Off
Windy Environment- Off

Mods Section:
If you are playing on TmodLoader you can better your performance by using any decent lag remover mod, these usually remove many particles and kill far away projectiles
POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT: I recommend all those who are not using a resource pack for different/better looks to use Optimizerraria.
This resourse pack will not change quality but all sprites are optimized to be more lightweight.
To install this, head to this page https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2447428824 or search for it in the steam workshop, and click "Subscribe".
After which you will find it in - Terraria Main Menu > Workshop > Use Resource Packs > Enable Optimizerraria

Explonations:

Resolution - Your highest monitor resolution will look best, reducing this is the worst case scenario, only proceed if all other optimizations don't fully fix your issue. 
Fullscreen will improve performance over borderless Window.
Parallax: Shouldn't impact fps on any non-extreme-copium hardware, in an extreme case set to 0%. Otherwise 100% will look best.
Frame Skip: If you can't get a consistent 60fps set it to off or subtle, make sure to expirement, it can cause slow motion effect.
Lighting: 
Color - Highest performance requirement best quality
White - Medium to high performance requirement 2nd best quality
Trippy - Medium Performance requirement 2nd worst quality
Retro - Lowest performance requirement worst quality
Quality: Simple, lowest best for performance, medium is in the middle, high is the worst for performance. Lowest looks the worst, medium is in the middle, high looks the best.
Background: Off for better performance, otherwise on
Blood and Gore: Off for better performance, otherwise on
Miner's Wobble: Off best for performance, otherwise on
Windy environment: Off best for performance, otherwise on
