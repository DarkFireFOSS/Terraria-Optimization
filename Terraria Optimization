Resolution:  your highest monitor resolution, reducing this is the worst case scenario, only proceed if all other optimizations don't fully fix your issue. 
Go fullscreen and borderless window should be disabled.

Parallax: Shouldn't impact fps on any non-extreme- copium hardware, in an extreme case set to 0%.
